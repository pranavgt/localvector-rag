# LocalVector RAG

## What

**LocalVector RAG** is a privacy-first, on-prem Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system.  
It combines a local vector store with a lightweight language model to answer questions using your private documents â€” without sending any data to the cloud.

This is my initial project demonstrates how to:
- Embed and index text chunks locally using FAISS with HNSW for fast approximate search.
- Retrieve relevant passages based on vector similarity.
- Feed retrieved passages to a local or API-based LLM to generate grounded answers.

## Why

Many organizations (finance, healthcare, legal) want AI-powered search or helpdesk features, but cannot send sensitive data to third-party APIs.  
LocalVector shows how to run a modern RAG pipeline entirely within a private network or on-premise setup.  
It helps bridge the gap between AI-powered answers and strict privacy or compliance requirements.

## How

### Basic Flow

1. **Ingest**: Load your documents and split them into smaller text chunks.
2. **Embed**: Generate vector embeddings for each chunk using a pre-trained model.
3. **Store**: Save embeddings in a FAISS index with an HNSW structure for efficient similarity search.
4. **Retrieve**: For a user query, embed the query and find the top matching chunks.
5. **Generate**: Provide the relevant context to an LLM to generate a reliable answer.
